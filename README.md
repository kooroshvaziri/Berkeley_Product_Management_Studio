# Product Management Studio: Lead Product Innovation Through Strategy and Storytelling

This repository documents my completion of the **UC Berkeley Executive Education Product Management Studio**. The program focused on the innovation capabilities model, balancing customer centricity with data-driven decision-making and AI-augmented strategic thinking.

## 🎯 Program Focus & Core Competencies
During this 8-week intensive program, I developed advanced tactics for managing products through their entire life cycle, with a specific emphasis on:

* **AI-Augmented Strategy:** Mastered the use of Berkeley's AI Product Strategy Co-Pilot to enhance decision-making and embed intelligent workflows into product team practices.
* **Human-Centered Design:** Leveraged design tools to capture value creation opportunities and integrate customer research into product roadmaps.
* **Strategic Storytelling:** Developed compelling product visions and customer journey maps to align cross-functional teams and engage senior stakeholders.
* **Economic Value Prioritization:** Focused on prioritizing Economic Value to the Customer (EVC) and managing the full cycle of value creation, delivery, and capture.

## 💼 Industry Experience (Genius Sports)
I applied these frameworks to real-world challenges within the sports technology sector via **Genius Sports**. Due to the proprietary nature of these projects, the specific deliverables and strategic roadmaps remain confidential.
